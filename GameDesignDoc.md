### Game Overview

The player will select an action from a list of options. The pet will react according to the action chosen and its own preferences, causing its stats to change. The pets shape will change determined by its current stats. 

Players manipulating their pet into their desired shape will need to look for ways to overcome limitations. As stats become more out of balance negative effects may cause slowdown or even pet death if not managed carfully.
