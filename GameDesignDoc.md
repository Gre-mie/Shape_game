Monster Rancher was originally released on the PlayStation1 console. Players could train their pets and enter them into battles. A physical CD of another game or media could be placed into the PlayStation to generate a monster from the CD.

### Player Experience

The player will care for and evolve a pet shape through training. Players will need to be mindful they pay attention to the health of the pet during training while encouraging prefered behaviours. Keeping the shapes stats ballanced to evolve their pet shape into a desired evolution to minimise effects from an over evolved stat. The game can be rewarding for players that evolve their pets through thoughtful training and punishes those who try to rush.

### Game Overview

The player will select an action from a list of options. The pet will react according to the action chosen and its own preferences, causing its stats to change. The pets shape will change determined by its current stats. 

Players manipulating their pet into their desired shape will need to look for ways to overcome limitations. As stats become more out of balance negative effects may cause slowdown or even pet death if not managed carfully.

### Theme Interpretation (Only One)

Only One - The pet only has one life, the lifetime of the pet depends solely on how the player treats it during training and how long they play for. A pet can die if the player over trains them and once the game ends the pet is abaondoned and left for dead. There is no way to retrieve or revive a pet. Once a pet is considered dead, the only option is to exit the game.

(I'd like to add a legue where you battle predesigned pets, so players can train their pet, evolving its shape to best be able to defeat the upcomming opponent. In this senario your pets death would also be perminent. An chance to forfit the fight to save the pet would be needed with a significant drop in the table)

### Primary Mechanics

The pet will prepare to train in different things, making a face that indicates what it is trying to learn.

**Prod**<br>
Use prod when the pet is trying to learn defence, attack or dodge. If the player prods the pet when it is not doing these actions the pet may loose health and/or fail in their attempted learning

**Rest**<br>
Tell the pet to go to sleep to regain health. Some stats make it hard to sleep

**Play**<br>
Tire the pet out by giving it some play time. This helps to reduce hyperness

**Feed**<br>
Give the pet a cookie. This may regenerate some health. Pets may prefure to train in something if they get a cookie afterwards.

#### Consequences

**Hype**<br>
When a pet becomes hyper they will vibrate slightly. Hyper pets are unable to sleep and will will learn stamina more slowly
